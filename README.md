# InstaMedia
Are you ever on Instagram and see a photo or video that you want to download? You can screenshot images but there really isn't an intuitive solution for videos. That is where InstaMedia comes in! InstaMedia can download the original photo or video from Instagram without it needing to be cropped.
(InstaMedia is being actively developed by Vishruth Gaur; please report an bugs and issues; InstaMedia is only available for iOS)

Directions: In order to use InstaMedia, you will need to have the shortcuts app downloaded and setup. In order to do so, install the shortcuts app from the App Store and download any random *official* shortcut (official shortcuts are those which are approved by Apple, these are the shortcuts that can be browsed and installed in the shortcuts app). After doing so, go to Settings>Shortcuts and turn on "Allow Untrusted Shortcuts". After doing so, click on the latest version of InstaMedia, click on the link (you may have to copy and paste it into your browser) and from there on, click on "Get Shortcut", this will redirect you to the Shortcuts app, and from there scroll down and clicl on "Add Untrusted Shortcut". In order to use InstaMedia, go to the Instagram post you would like to download and click on the three dots in top right of the post and click on "Share to...", from there scroll down and click on InstaMedia. Now you should have the post downloaded onto your device!
